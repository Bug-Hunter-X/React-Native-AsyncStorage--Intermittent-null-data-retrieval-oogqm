# React Native AsyncStorage Intermittent Null Retrieval

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with AsyncStorage in React Native where data retrieval inconsistently returns null, even when data was successfully stored.  The root cause remains undetermined, but the provided code showcases the issue and a potential workaround.

## Bug Description
The application uses AsyncStorage to persistently store and retrieve user data. However, retrieving the data occasionally results in a null value, despite successful storage confirmation. This behavior is inconsistent and not readily reproducible on demand. 

## Solution
The proposed solution introduces retry logic to attempt data retrieval multiple times before considering the data truly unavailable.  This mitigates, but does not definitively fix, the underlying problem.  Further investigation may uncover a more robust fix.
